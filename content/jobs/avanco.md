**Engagements**

##### Fairfax County Public Schools

Helped the customer convert their existing reporting architecture from Crystal Enterprise to OBIEE 10g/11g.  Also developed new reports and dashboards as requested by the customer.  Worked within a five-person reporting team â€“ duties included physical and logical data modeling, data loading with PL/SQL and Informatica, and report and dashboard development.  Researched and delivered custom solutions for requirements that were not possible with standard functionality in OBIEE.  Also performed QA of data and reports, performance tuning, and served as backup for the primary OBIEE system administrator.  The business intelligence system was used for evaluating student standardized test performance.
